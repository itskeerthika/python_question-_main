1) What does the following code do?
```
a=10
print(a)
```

2) What does the following code do?
```
a=10
print(a)
b=20
print(b)
```
3) What does the following code do?
```
a=10
print(a)
b=20
print(b)
print(a+b)
print(a*b)
```

4) what will be the output of below code?
```
a=10
print(a)
a=a+1
print(a)
```

5) what will be the output of below code?
```
a=10
print(a)
a=a+1
print(a)
a=a+1
print(a)
```
6) what will be the output of below code?
```
a=10
print(a)
a=a+1
print(a)
a=a+1
print(a)
a=a+1
print(a)
```


7) What will be the output?
```
print("Enter a number:")
n=int(input())
print(n)
print(n+1)
print(n+2)
print(n+3)
```

8) How would you take input from Command line and print it?

9) Take an input from command line as "GOKUL" and store it in a variable 'a' , what will be the output?
```
LINE-1
print(a*2)
```

10) Replace LINE-1 and LINE-2, so that we take input from user,  a number as input form user and we should print the square of the number as output.
```
LINE-1
LINE-2
```
