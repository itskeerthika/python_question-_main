# Problem-7

# Create a dictionary D with the following structure:

#     key: numbers from 1 to 100, endpoints included
#     value: set of factors of key

# Using this information, find a pair of numbers in the range

# [1,100][1,100] that have the most number of factors in common. If there are multiple pairs, store all such pairs as a list of tuples.
