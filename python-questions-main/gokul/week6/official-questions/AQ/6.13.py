# Problem-13

# Extract the Name and Mathematics marks of all students from the Scores Dataset and store them as a list of tuples. Each tuple should be of the form: (Name, Mathematics). Sort this list in ascending order of marks. If there are two students who have scored the same marks, then sort based on the Name (alphabetical order). Note that the final list should also be a list of tuples.
