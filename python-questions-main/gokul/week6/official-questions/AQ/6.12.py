# Problem-12

# Consider the following graph on the Scores Dataset:

#     Each student is represented by a node in the graph.
#     There is an edge between two students 

# ii and

#     jj in the graph if they are from the same CityTown.

# Construct the adjacency matrix corresponding to this graph. Solve the problem with these two approaches:

#     nested lists
#     nested dictionaries
