# You are given the results of a sequence of matches played by India in ODIs. A win is represented by 'W' and a loss is represented by 'L'. A winning streak is a string of consecutive wins. For example, if India has played five matches with the following results - 'WLWWWL' - then it has a three-match streak. Write a code to accept the result-sequence as input and find the longest streak in it.
